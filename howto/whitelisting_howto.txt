[White-listing tutorial]

We have two different approaches for white-listing i) function name based
approach and ii) location(file name, line, and column) based approach. 
You can edit whitelist.files(function name based white-listing) and
exclude.files(location based white-listing) to employ these approaches.

Both files should be located under '/opt/stonesoup/etc/


== White-listing by location with "exclude.files" ==

1. Edit exculde.files

This file contains information for ioc-helpers. All entries inside the file will
be overlooked by InfoApp pass. Each entry is of the form:

<filename> <line> <col>

*ATTENTION* 
- There should be *a* whitespace between each name.
- If both line and column are 0, then all errors occurring from that file are
ignored, and in this case, only the filename is checked.

Example entry:

dfa.c 2735 30
HTInet.c 0 0
regexec.c 1082 57

2. Re-run the TC
 - This doesn't require re-compilation of the source.


== White-listing by function name with "whitelist.files" == 

1.  Edit whitelist.files

The file whitelist.files, contains the functions to be whitelisted. Each entry
is of the form,

<function>,<file>,<is_conversion>,<is_overflow>,<is_shift>

- <function> is the function in which the error appears
- <file> is the name of the file containing <function> (without the full path,
  e.x. for /src/regex.c file is regex.c)
- <is_conversion> is either ‘true’ or ‘false’, depending on the type of the
  error(true for conv. errors)
- <is_overflow> is either ‘true’ or ‘false’
- <is_shift> is either ‘true’ or ‘false’ 

Example file:
  wsincr,kwset.c,false,true,false
  cherokee_plugin_post_track_init,post_track.c,true,true,true
  ret_tentry_new,post_track.c,true,true,true
  _unregister,post_track.c,true,true,true
  cherokee_generic_post_track_free,post_track.c,true,true,true
  0,0,false,false,false

*ATTENTION*
- There should be *NO* whitespaces between the commas.
- Last entry of the file should always be 
	0,0,false,false,false

2. Rebuild the sources

3. Re-run the TC
